# ProtGraphCpp 

Currently an unfinished implementation of querying Protein-Graphs by weights and possibly more.

## RoadMap
This is a ordered RoadMap which will be worked on. Keep in mind that Some points are currently not considered (like variable number of "limit_variants" or "PDB-entries")


- Create unified Python CPP Graph Export (with all attributes, containing preferebly multiple pdb entries generated by ProtGraph, since code is already available in python)
- Create a Graph Class containing:
  - Nodes/Edges and Attributes (containing PDBs) in CSR Format (most compact)
  - ABI for getting Next Edges Nodes efficiently?
  - Implement topological Order Retrieval in CPP (and cache it in this object)
  - Have PDBs in an efficient repr. for many comparisons
- CLI for the most basic things
- Single Threaded loading into RAM (looking at the Memory Consumption of Human, Vertibrates, UP?)
- Single Threaded Implementation of the query by weights (without limiting factor)
- API on how to call this cpp program! (REST?!?! Socket? Binary is prefered here!)
- Add Multithreading and hopefully have some nice results :) 
- Use a "Numpy" Library for complex calculations (Eigen? Maybe ask some experts)
